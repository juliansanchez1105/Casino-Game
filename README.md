Casino Game: Julian Sanchez, Nikhil Osuri, Xhaiden D'Souza, Animish Jain 
Our project is a text-based Casino Game with 3 games inside. When you start the program, you can create an account that will save your progress. The 3 games are: the Slots, Wheel Spin, and 2 variations of Dice Roll. You start out with $1000 and you try to win your way to $500,000. You can bet however much you want and test your luck. If you get to $500,000, you can either reset your progress or continue playing.
